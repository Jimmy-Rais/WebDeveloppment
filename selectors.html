	It is essential for us to know whether man, without the help of the eternal or of ration-
alistic thought, can unaided create his own values . . . the uneasiness that concerns
us belongs to a whole epoch from which we do not want to dissociate ourselves. . . .
We know that everything is not summed up in negation and absurdity

	The Wall, Camus can be seen to object to
Sartre’s depiction of human freedom as both total and futile. For Camus, as David
Sprintzen notes, the characters of Sartre’s fiction have “absolutised their freedom
to compensate for a transcendent absolute by whose absence they are haunted”.
Furthermore, this freedom “bears witness to a deeper isolation from the world
around them and, most particularly, from nature” (Sprintzen 1988: 44). In the world
described by Sartre, the individual is “reduced to self-contemplation”, is conscious
of “his profound indifference to everything that is not himself ”, is “alone, enclosed
in this freedom”. This solipsism is symptomatic of the discovery of the absurd but,
says Camus in a review of Sartre’s Nausea in 1938, “the realisation that life is absurd
cannot be an end, but only a beginning. This is a truth that nearly all great minds
have taken as their starting point. It is not this discovery that is interesting, but the
consequences and rules for action that can be drawn from it.”

	Not without reason, the term “absurd” rarely now makes an appearance in academic
discourse, even academic discourse on existentialist philosophy, with which the
term is usually associated. However, the importance of the concept to Camus’s
intellectual trajectory cannot be overstated, and a detailed account of what he
means by the absurd would be necessary for any serious discussion of his ideas. A
convenient way of introducing this analysis is to contrast Camus’s concept of the
absurd with those versions articulated by the existentialists Kierkegaard and Sartre.
Such a contrast will further serve to highlight the extent to which Camus was not an
existentialist. For Sartre, with whom the idea is perhaps most usually associated, the
term “absurd” denoted the contingent nature of human existence, the realization of
which brings what he called nausea. In Hazel Barnes’s translation of Being and
Nothingness, the Sartrean absurd is defined as “That which is meaningless. Thus
man’s existence is absurd because his contingency finds no external justification”
(Sartre 1956: 628). In marked contrast, for Kierkegaard, the absurd refers to that
quality of Christian faith that runs counter to all mundane human experience or,
